In 2001, the first World Toilet Summit was held, bringing together policymakers, experts, and advocates to address global sanitation issues.\n\nIn 2013, the United Nations officially adopted World Toilet Day as an international observance. This decision was driven by the recognition of the severe global sanitation crisis, where billions of people lack access to proper sanitation facilities. The day was aligned with the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, specifically Goal 6, which aims to ensure clean water and sanitation for all.\n\nSince its official adoption, World Toilet Day has grown into a powerful platform for raising awareness and promoting action. Governments, NGOs, and private sectors organize events, campaigns, and initiatives worldwide to improve access to toilets and educate people about hygiene practices. Over the years, this day has not only shed light on sanitation challenges but also fostered innovative solutions, partnerships, and investments in sanitation infrastructure.",

Presidents' Day invites citizens to reflect on the values of leadership, service, and the enduring impact of the presidency on American society.",
      "origin": "The origins of Presidents' Day trace back to the celebration of George Washington’s birthday on February 22. First recognized as a federal holiday in 1885, it was initially dedicated solely to Washington, whose leadership during the American Revolution and as the first president set foundational precedents for the nation.\n\nIn 1971, the Uniform Monday Holiday Act shifted the holiday to the third Monday in February, creating a long weekend and unofficially broadening its scope to honor all U.S. presidents. This change also aligned with efforts to standardize holiday observances and promote economic benefits from extended weekends.\n\nPresidents' Day has since become a reflection of American history and the evolving role of the presidency. The holiday highlights the achievements and challenges of past leaders, encouraging citizens to appreciate the significance of effective leadership in shaping the nation's path.",
      "guide": "Celebrate Presidents' Day by learning about the lives and accomplishments of U.S. presidents. Visit historical landmarks, museums, or libraries dedicated to presidential history, such as Mount Vernon, the Lincoln Memorial, or the presidential libraries.\n\nEngage in educational activities, such as reading biographies, watching documentaries, or participating in discussions about leadership and democracy. Schools and community organizations often host events to teach about the contributions of past presidents.\n\nTake time to reflect on the principles of democracy and public service. Consider volunteering or engaging in civic activities as a way to honor the spirit of leadership and dedication exemplified by the presidency. Share your insights and experiences on social media to inspire others to participate.",
      "taboos": "- Avoid oversimplifying or romanticizing the roles of presidents without acknowledging their complexities.\n- Do not ignore the broader historical context and its impact on all citizens.\n- Avoid reducing the holiday solely to commercial activities like shopping sales."
