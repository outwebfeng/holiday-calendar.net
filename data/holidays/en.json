It aims to raise awareness about the critical role toilets play in public health and sustainable development. Every year, this day emphasizes the need to ensure proper sanitation for everyone and to address the global sanitation crisis.\n\nThe event was established by the United Nations in 2013 as a way to focus global attention on the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6.2, which advocates for access to adequate sanitation and hygiene for all by 2030. Each year, a unique theme is chosen to underline specific sanitation challenges and solutions.\n\nWorld Toilet Day serves as a reminder of the 3.6 billion people worldwide who still lack safely managed sanitation. It brings governments, organizations, and communities together to initiate and support efforts to improve global sanitation infrastructure and practices.",
      "origin": "World Toilet Day originated from the advocacy efforts of the World Toilet Organization, founded in 2001 by Jack Sim, a sanitation activist. Sim’s mission was to break the taboo surrounding toilets and sanitation by initiating open discussions about these essential topics. In 2001, the first World Toilet Summit was held, bringing together policymakers, experts, and advocates to address global sanitation issues.\n\nIn 2013, the United Nations officially adopted World Toilet Day as an international observance. This decision was driven by the recognition of the severe global sanitation crisis, where billions of people lack access to proper sanitation facilities. The day was aligned with the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, specifically Goal 6, which aims to ensure clean water and sanitation for all.\n\nSince its official adoption, World Toilet Day has grown into a powerful platform for raising awareness and promoting action. Governments, NGOs, and private sectors organize events, campaigns, and initiatives worldwide to improve access to toilets and educate people about hygiene practices. Over the years, this day has not only shed light on sanitation challenges but also fostered innovative solutions, partnerships, and investments in sanitation infrastructure.",
